// creating angular service. Using local refs and angular directives are good for smaller scale apps but for scalability and centralization,

// services are a class which become injectable as dependency for different components

    return [...this.posts]; // creating new array using spread operator (...) to split apart posts array.
  }

  addPost(title: string, content: string) {

    // creating post object
